# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
We are creating an interactive recipe book called Code: Food. This will be a collection of recipes that can be user submitted and Admin established. Admin will have the capabilities to review, add, delete, and approve new recipes. The user will be able to interact by saving recipes to their favorites, submitting new recipes for review and creating their own profile. There will also be a search fumction where users or browsers can search for recipes based on dietary restriction, meal time, type of cuisine and main ingredient. 

Our idea came from the fact that we all love food and it is a unifying experience. We are also close to the holidays and we thought it would be fun to create an app that would make it easy for people to find recipes that everyone can enjoy. We have also included a feature where if a certain searched for ingredient or cuisine can not be found, we will link a nearby restaurant in the Kansas City area where you can order that item.
